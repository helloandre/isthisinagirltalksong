## Is This In A Girl Talk Song?

There have been several occasions where I can think of a particular sample in a girl talk song, but can't remember where or which song it's in. This helps that predicament a bit. Fortunately, there are a plethora of decent-quality Girl Talk videos on YouTube, so generally when you search for a girl talk song with "girl talk < song name >" it is the first hit.

### Highlights

Pulled a complete list of samples from [this site](http://www.illegal-tracklist.net/Main/HomePage).

Parsed it and generated the objects.js with parse.php.

All searching done client-side (even works in mobile browsers!)

### TODO

The very next thing to happen is to have an 'autocorrect' feature (closest matching word). but that's harder than 6 hours on a friday night.

The next step in this is to make lyrics searchable too. I have a sneaky suspision this _won't_ be done client-side.
